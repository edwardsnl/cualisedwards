<p>Assignment 1: System Evaluation</p>


<h2>Institution Background</h2>
<p>The Library of Congress is the largest library in the world, and is the main research arm of the U.S. Congress and home of the U.S. Copyright Office. It is located in Washington, D.C.</p>


<h2>Project Information</h2>
<p>The establishment of the World Digital Library was first proposed in a speech in June 2005 by then-Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. The basic idea was to “create an Internet-based, easily-accessible collection of the world’s cultural riches that would tell the stories and highlight the achievements of all countries and cultures, thereby promoting cross-cultural awareness and understanding.”

    The library officially launched in 2009 as a project of the U.S. Library of Congress. The project sought to preserve, share, and increase access to the world’s cultural artifacts and historical documents. It has received support and contributions from all over the world.

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> Ultimately, experts identified that there was not a lot of cultural content that was digitized, and that many countries did not have the capacity to digitize or display their treasures. Many existing websites, at the time, did not have properly developed sites that could host, display or allow searching for content, and there was not multilingual access. Thus, this project was born!
    </p>

<h2>System Specification</h2>
<p>After operating for more than 10 years, the Library of Congress transitioned the world-wide collection to the LOC’s main website. The original <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0018836/">World Digital Library</a> site is currently preserved by the Library of Congress Web Archive, and the current collection (where you can search and peruse) is housed on the LOC’s main <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/world-digital-library/about-this-collection/">website.</a> </p>

<h2> Users </h2>
<p>The collection is for users all around the world–more than 100 languages are represented. Based on the way the information is presented, it seems like this website may not be best for children (in terms of digital literacy proficiency), or those who do not understand how to use digital archives.</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The materials collected by the WDL include cultural treasures and significant historical documents including books, manuscripts, maps, newspapers, journals, prints, photographs, sound recordings, and films. There are 19,506 collection items online.
    On the homepage for Collection Items, you will find the type of material (i.e. book), the contributor, the date, and the pages of the resources. The catalog record includes title, when it was created/published, the medium, the call number/physical location, the online format, additional metadata formats. 
    </p>

<h2>Technical Description</h2>
<p>This is a website with a substantial database that houses and manages a collection of digital content. There are options to choose the format (with options such as newspaper, notated music, web page, or book), which online format (options including image, compressed data, PDF, online text, video and audio), the date, the location, contributor, which digital library the item came from, the subject, and the language. There is also an option to search the collection. When a specific item is chosen, the user can view the specific item, as well as the metadata for the item. There is also information about rights and access (related to copyright and restrictions), how to cite this item, options to look through “More resources” where there are options to click through related items,  “More items like this” where there is simple metadata (title, type of item (i.e. book), and a brief description), and other options other “You might also like.” There’s a button at the top of the item to go “Back to Search Results” and under the item, there is an option to download the item.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Evaluation: Pros and Cons</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Pros: </h3>
    <ul style="text-align:left;"> 
        <li>The multitude of options to refine your search result.</li>
        <li>The availability of sources from the year 1000 to now.</li>
        <li>The availability of sources in over 100 languages.</li>
        <li>There are permalinks for the items.</li>
        <li>There are options to download the items.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Cons: </h3>
    <ul style="text-align:left;"> 
        <li>If you do not know as much about the source you are looking for, it may be difficult to find by clicking through the options. You can search for broad topics, but the search leads to items that have the search terms in the title or description which may not be as helpful for the research.</li>
        <li>It may be difficult to look through many of the items if there is a visual disability because there are pictures/scanned images of books that may not be meet all ADA standards.</li>
        <li>The website is in English, and even the location names are in English if one wanted to search for their own country in their language.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<p>I think having options for an advanced search would make this digital collection even better. The librarians that have created the metadata were extremely detailed so having the opportunity to boolean search through the collection could be monumental for a research.
</p>
<p>There should also be options for those who speak another language other than English, and perhaps some specific sources curated for those who have to use screen readers. </p>

<h3>Example of a collection item, when chosen: </h3>
