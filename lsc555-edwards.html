		<h1> Hi. Welcome to this basic webpage. </h1>
		<h2> This homework assignment was created by Nina-Simone. </h2>
		<h3> (Not the singer) </h3>
		<p> Today was an interesting day. Although I have gone my entire life with people hearing my name and saying, “Oh like the singer,” it happened more than once in a single location. Now, I normally wouldn’t be bothered, but it just hasn't happened more than once in one day—let alone in one location. Here are the places where someone mentioned Nina-Simone today (Feb 9): 
			<ul>
			<li> When I first attempted to check in at the airport </li>
			<li> When I tried to check in again (long story) </li>
			<li> When I was going through TSA </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> If you don’t know who Nina-Simone is, go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Simone" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

		<footer> By the way, my parents didn’t know who Nina-Simone was until I was 5! </footer>
