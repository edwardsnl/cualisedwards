<h1>Comparison of Results From Heuristic Evaluation and Usability Test</h1>
<p>We both agree that the site, although basic, was aesthetically pleasing. Beau found that the website was easy to understand and parse through, which is something I noted in the heuristic analysis. As far as negatives, Beau did not find the system efficient to use, nor did it provide feedback to make sure there was an understanding. I didn’t note this lack of feedback in my description of the top 2 weaknesses, but it is encompassed in the fact that the website does not allow for recognition rather than recall. You are wholly on your own (with your own memory) when going through the website, without any sort of feedback or help to remember how you have been parsing the website. This may have also been why Beau disagreed with the idea that the system was engaging and enjoyable to use. I noted in my heuristic analysis that there was no real user control or freedom. Beau described how slow the archive was and that it was not easy to use. Without clear emergency exits, having to work through a slow archive with only a few options is what made the experience difficult. 

    I would suggest that the website provide more feedback or instructions, allow for more user flexibility, and create more avenues for users to engage with “recognition, rather than recall” (such as through visible paths to allow users to make mistakes and/or navigate back to previous pages). It’s an easy-to-understand website, but the ease was overlooked by the burden of how difficult it truly was to search and find material.
