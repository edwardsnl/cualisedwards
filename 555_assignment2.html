<h1>Hueristic Evaluation</h1>

<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 3px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Topic: American Immigration</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">General Notes </h3>
    <ul style="text-align:left;"> 
        <li>Articles are in random order and there’s nothing showing why or how they were picked. Seems to only enable a simple keyword search. A student opinion piece and a poll came up before articles about politics which are more focused on American immigration. However, the first piece under the 2 listed above is from 2021. The one next to it (the fourth piece) is from this year and focuses on current issues in immigration.</li>
        <li>I clicked on an article “End of Asylum?” With Dr. Julia G. Young. There were more stories at the bottom. And options to leave a reply at the bottom, with archives on the right</li>
        <li>The “path” at the top of the article says “Home/2020/February/”End of Asylum?” With Dr. Julia G. Young” making it hard to remember which page I was on before or go back to the search results page</li>
        <li>I had to blackclick on the whole page. Clicked on a new page and found a similar path “Home/2024/November/ Student Perspective: Are Friendships Across the Aisle Possible?" Note that this article was not related to the topic.</li>
        <li>Backclicked and looked at a student opinion piece on a debate on immigration funding. There were not any issues related to how quickly the page was loading, until I clicked on a link that was hyperlinked in the website. There were a few seconds of nothing happening and then it worked (could have been a wifi issue). Generally, the page would show an orange circle that completed itself if it took a bit to get to the next page.</li>
        <li>At the bottom of one article, I clicked the article that was “Next” and at this point, it will take 2 backclicks to get back to my search results.</li>
        <li>I added “2025” to my search and got only one article as a result which does not make sense as there were other articles written in 2025 that talks about immigration (but it probably didn’t have the word “American” in the article or title. i.e. one had “U.S. Immigration”)</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<h2>Usability Heuristics</h2>
<ul style="text-align:left;"> 
    <li>Visibility of system status: The design did keep users fairly informed by the orange circle that completed itself to show that the website was loading. However, there was not any feedback that would help a user parse through the website. </li>
    <li>Match the system and the real world: The design did speak the users’ language. The phrases, words and concepts used would be familiar to any English-speaking user. </li>
    <li>User control and freedom: Users could not make mistakes–especially when conducting a search. There were no emergency exits at all on the site. </li>
    <li>Consistency and standards: There were no real issues regarding consistency and standards. However the “archive” was not truly an archive as it didn’t go back to the very beginning of the paper.</li>
    <li>Error prevention: There were no error messages (although I didn’t experience any errors). But in terms of eliminating error-prone conditions, the search was limited and, again, there was limited user control which could lead to errors.</li>
    <li>Recognition rather than recall: This was probably the largest issue noted. Should a student want to make a search, they would have to go backclick in order to go back to the search results page, which would require remembering how many pages they went through and what they were initially going for. If there were multiple searches or multiple articles read, this would be very difficult to do because the path options only showed the path from the archive, not the search results page.</li>
    <li>Flexibility and efficiency in use: There were not many shortcuts to speed up the interaction, beyond being able to go to specific menu items or back to the homepage. Those were great, but being able to go back to the search results page would have been especially helpful. So there were a few, but there could be more to make the user/student experience more efficient.</li>
    <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design: If students wanted to view a website about a newspaper, the website is minimally designed and aesthetically pleasing. For the purpose of a student searching an archive, a lot was going on which would result in a lower score for this heuristic. In general, though, the design was basic and will be deemed aesthetically pleasing because the site was presumably not made to be a search engine. </li>
    <li>Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: I didn’t experience any errors, so I could not tell if there were error messages for a user to decipher. </li>
    <li>Help and documentation: The site could have used more of an explanation regarding the archive and search function. When searching, the user is guided through the archive, which explains the path at the top of the page. An explanation about that would have been useful and potentially helped with error prevention. </li>
</ul>

<div style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 3px;">
    <h2>Top Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
    <h3>Top 2 Strengths:</h3>
    <p>The design of the website is aesthetically pleasing and minimalistic. It is not overwhelming, and the consistency of the archives and search box being on the side, and the links to the main pages at the top makes it easy to, at least, navigate to the main pages and to archives and a search. Another strength is that when a page took more than a second to load, there was a little orange circle that completed itself to let me know that the page was loading (relating to visibility of system status).</p>
    <h3>Top 2 Weaknesses:</h3>
    <p>When I completed a search and clicked on an article from the search results, there were issues with recognition rather than recall. I had to remember which page I was on because the path at the top of the article did not show that I was coming from a search results page. This meant that as I progressed in the search from this article, I would have had to back click a certain amount of times instead of being able to follow the path at the top of the page. There was a path, but it was related to archives and not the path that I was actually progressing through the website. Further, 
        this meant that if I accidentally clicked on an article, I would have had to back click in order to go back instead of clicking on a part of the path–thus, there was no real user control or freedom due to the lack of a clearly marked emergency exit.

<h1>Comparison of Results From Heuristic Evaluation and Usability Test</h1>
<p>We both agree that the site, although basic, was aesthetically pleasing. Beau found that the website was easy to understand and parse through, which is something I noted in the heuristic analysis. As far as negatives, Beau did not find the system efficient to use, nor did it provide feedback to make sure there was an understanding. I didn’t note this lack of feedback in my description of the top 2 weaknesses, but it is encompassed in the fact that the website does not allow for recognition rather than recall. You are wholly on your own (with your own memory) when going through the website, without any sort of feedback or help to remember how you have been parsing the website. This may have also been why Beau disagreed with the idea that the system was engaging and enjoyable to use. I noted in my heuristic analysis that there was no real user control or freedom. Beau described how slow the archive was and that it was not easy to use. Without clear emergency exits, having to work through a slow archive with only a few options is what made the experience difficult. 

    I would suggest that the website provide more feedback or instructions, allow for more user flexibility, and create more avenues for users to engage with “recognition, rather than recall” (such as through visible paths to allow users to make mistakes and/or navigate back to previous pages). It’s an easy-to-understand website, but the ease was overlooked by the burden of how difficult it truly was to search and find material.
